# COVID-19-Predictions
Daily Forecasting of New Cases for Regional Epidemics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 with Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification

This is a research products of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Scienceâ€™s National Virtual Biotechnology Laboratory (NVBL), a consortium of national laboratories (Argonne, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Sandia) focused on responding to COVID-19. The objectives of this effort are 1) near real-time situational awareness, 2) predictive analytics, and 3) a web platform providing policy-makers and the public access to NVBL predictions.

This repository archives predictions from models for regional COVID-19 epidemics. Bayesian inference is used to quantify uncertainty in daily forecasts of expected reporting of new cases, enabling identification of new trends in surveillance data.

The methodology is described in ```/methodology/Manuscript-draft.pdf```. This repository only archives the compartmental model described in the manuscript.
