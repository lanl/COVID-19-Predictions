### Overview

When will the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign allow the United States (US) to safely end nonpharmaceutical interventions? The answer depends partly on the herd immunity threshold (HIT), which is a function of the basic reproduction number, which characterizes disease transmission dynamics within a na√Øve population in the absence of any intervention. Because these dynamics are population-specific, the vaccination penetrance required to reach herd immunity may vary from community to community. Here, using Bayesian inference, we parameterized a compartmental model with regional surveillance data available for each of the 50 states and 384 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the US. This procedure allowed us to obtain MSA-specific R_0 and HIT estimates. Using this information and estimates of actual disease burden, we can determine the number of vaccinations required to reach herd immunity in each state and US MSA.
